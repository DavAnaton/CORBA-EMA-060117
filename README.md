## Messenger

[![LogoMessenger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavAnaton/CORBA-EMA-060117/master/Docs/logo.png)]()

Messenger is a Client-server messenger application using CORBA on Java we had to develop for my third year in engineering school at l'École des Mines d'Alès.

For now, you can:
  - Run the server
  - Open 2+ consoles
  - Discuss with your friends


### Installation

Messenger is running using [CORBA](http://www.corba.org/).

You can find a small tutorial on CORBA right  [here](http://www.ejbtutorial.com/programming/tutorial-for-corba-hello-world-using-java).

In order to run the server, you need to run ```orbd```.

```sh
$ start orbd -ORBInitialPort <port>
```

### Development

Want to contribute?
We still have much to do. Here's a small list:
#### Todos

- Create a GUI
- Create different chat rooms
- Push notifications
- Eventually, one day, we'll maybe have to care about security. ;)
